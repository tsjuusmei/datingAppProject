I have done desk research to see how other dating websites/applications are being used and what the intentions are from the creators, as well as the users.

## [Tinder](https://tinder.com/?lang=nl)

Tinder is a very fast way to swipe, match and date with new people in your area.
It's user base is on mobile and is focused on matching people through photo's of the person's profile. Liking and disliking is easily done with a swipe and matching therefor can go really fast. 
When there is a match you can immediately chat with your match. 
Tinder is made for anyone and any sexual preference.

People on Tinder are both looking for short- and long term relationships.

Tinder is very easy (and free) to use and has a big amount of users, however there are also fake accounts on there.

## [Pepper](https://www.pepper.nl/)

Pepper is focused on matching on the interests of their users. Users can make a collection of their interests and try to match with people with, somewhat, the same interests. They can make their own profile with their own pictures, so there's lots of room for creativity.

Pepper is free, easy to use and also a lot of fun to use and match with people.

## [The Inner Circle](https://www.theinnercircle.co/)

The Inner Circle is a special one, because there are strict registration requirements, so you can't simply join it.
It is based on straight people only and is available on mobile as well as on desktop, and you do need a paid subscription.
You can also be invited to The Inner Circle, but you will still be completely screened.


## [Parship](https://www.parship.nl/)
<img src="https://www.datingsitekeuze.nl/wp-content/uploads/parship.png" width="250">

Parship is focused on singles who are 40 years or older. The people on here are looking for a long term relationship and are at least 30 years or older.
It is completely free to use and the matches are based on a form that you fill in quickly after logging in.

## [Happn](https://www.happn.com/nl/)
<img src="https://www.datingscout.nz/b6/image/upload/ds/upload/reviews/ENG/happn/happn-logo.jpg" width="250">

Happn is based on finding the person you have crossed paths with in public, and you find interesting.
At first it's free to use, but later on you probably have to pay to match with someone.
It matches on the public places people have been and that favors the odds of having the same interests.
